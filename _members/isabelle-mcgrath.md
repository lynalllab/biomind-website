Isabelle is a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. Working closely with Dr Mary-Ellen Lynall and Professor Naomi Wray, her research uses functional genomics to identify the genes and cell types causally involved in psychiatric disorders. During her PhD at the University of Queensland, she investigated the genetic and epidemiological overlap between endometriosis and its comorbid conditions. Outside the lab, she enjoys making pasta, reading novels, becoming rapidly addicted to new sports, and reminiscing about Australian winter.
