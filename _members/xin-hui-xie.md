Xinhui is a postdoctoral researcher who joined the Lynall Lab in 2025. He comes from China and works as a psychiatrist with more than ten years of clinical experience. He was awarded his PhD in psychiatry in 2024 from Wuhan University in China.

Xinhui is interested in developing and applying new methods in clinical research. In recent years, he has used brain-derived extracellular vesicles as a proxy for the brain to study the link between neuroinflammation and mental illness. He also designed a method to extract these vesicles from urine. In addition, he designed a new ECT strategy, called Hybrid-ECT, which reduces side effects while preserving effectiveness.

Outside the lab, Xinhui loves photography. His friends say he might earn more money as a photographer than as a researcher.
