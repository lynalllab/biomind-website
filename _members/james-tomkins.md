James is interested in the involvement of the immune system in psychiatric disorders using integrative approaches across omics technologies. Previously his research has focussed on brain ageing and neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis through the lens of transcriptomics and protein interaction data. Outside the lab, he’s often out cycling.
